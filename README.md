# Learning Verilog

## Purpose:
- I want to try doing the [fromthetransistor](https://github.com/geohot/fromthetransistor) course posted by geohot, and it requires some implementation with Verilog so I might as well try learning Verilog first
- Will directly learn verilog from the tutorial on this link http://www.referencedesigner.com/tutorials/verilog/verilog_01.php
